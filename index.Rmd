I'll keep a list of my little projects here.

## Textbook Notes

Notes on Richard McElreath's "Statistical Rethinking":  
[Link to notes](https://jake-lawler.github.io/rethinking/)  
Chapter summaries, questions answered, plots recreated in tidyverse etc.  

Much less comprehensive notes on "Statistics" by David Freedman, Robert Pisani, and Roger Purves:  
[Link to notes](https://jake-lawler.github.io/Statistics-FPP/)  
Just brief chapter summaries, no answers to questions or similar.

Scattered notes, animations, and question answers from my read through of "Statistical Inference" by George Casella and Roger Berger:  
[Link to notes](https://jake-lawler.github.io/StatisticalInference/)  
Still fairly early on with these. Even after my first full work-through I think I'll be revisiting and adding to these notes for a while.

I've barely started ‘SQL for Data Scientists’ by Renée M. P. Teate, but all my notes will go [here](https://jake-lawler.github.io/SQLforDataScientists/).
