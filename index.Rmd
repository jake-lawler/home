I'll keep a list of my little projects here.

## Textbook Notes

Notes on Richard McElreath's "Statistical Rethinking":  
[Link to notes](https://jake-lawler.github.io/rethinking/)  
Chapter summaries, questions answered, plots recreated in tidyverse etc.  

Much less comprehensive notes on "Statistics" by David Freedman, Robert Pisani, and Roger Purves:  
[Link to notes](https://jake-lawler.github.io/Statistics-FPP/)  
Just brief chapter summaries, no answers to questions or similar.

Scattered notes, plots, and a couple of animations from my read through of "Statistical Inference" by George Casella and Roger Berger:  
[Link to notes](https://jake-lawler.github.io/StatisticalInference/)  
Still fairly early on with these. Even after my first full work-through I think I'll be revisiting and adding to these notes for a while.

I'm reading through "Regression and Other Stories" by Gelman, Hill & Vehtari. I'm not making chapter notes and instead am trying to improve my base Stan writing by recreating the models presented there. Only just started, notes [here](https://jake-lawler.github.io/RegressionStories/).

Notes on "SQL for Data Scientists" by Ren√©e M. P. Teate are [here](https://jake-lawler.github.io/SQLforDataScientists/).
