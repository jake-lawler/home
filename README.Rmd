I'll keep a list of my little projects here.

## Textbook Notes

Notes  on Richard McElreath's "Statistical Rethinking":  
[Link to notes](https://jake-lawler.github.io/rethinking/)  
Chapter summaries, questions answered, plots recreated in tidyverse etc.  
Working on updating these to use tidybayes and raw Stan.

Much less comprehensive notes on "Statistics" by David Freedman, Robert Pisani, and Roger Purves:  
[Link to notes](https://jake-lawler.github.io/Statistics-FPP/)  
Just brief chapter summaries, no answers to questions or similar.

Scattered notes, animations, and question answers from my read through of "Statistical Inference" by George Casella and Roger Berger:  
[Link to notes](https://jake-lawler.github.io/StatisticalInference/)  
Just started these, there's not much in there yet.

## Shiny Apps
 
Should have a couple up shortly.
